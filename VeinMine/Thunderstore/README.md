Tired of mining for ages?  
With Veinmine you're able to mine the whole ore/rock vein at once!  
You can do this by holding down the assigned key (Left Alt by default) while mining!

## **Version 1.0.0 - Progressive mode added!**

### **Please delete your previous config when updating as it might break something.**

You can now enable progressive mode in the config, making it so veinmining is scaled by your Pickaxes level. This is intended to be a less OP way of veinmining, where the tradeoff is taking higher durability damage (and less xp) than if you mined manually.

The radius of the veinmined area is also scaled by your Pickaxes level.  
  
It works by checking for rocks in a radius set by the Progressive Level Multiplier value in the config. This value is multiplied by your Pickaxes level to obtain a radius.  
  
By default, it's set to 0.1 so assuming your Pickaxes level is 20, the radius will be 0.1 * 20 = 2.  
  
What does 2 mean, you ask?  
  
It's simple! A standard 2x2 floor piece has a length of 2, exactly like its name suggests.
